# Open Source Software

I maintain a couple of **open source projects** and contribute to many.

Here are a few of the projects that I maintain:

- [awesome-dj](https://github.com/endormi/awesome-dj) - List of reasons why django is awesome for web development & django bootstrap boilerplate.
- [automation](https://github.com/endormi/automation) - Collection of my automated things written in Python.
- [devisle/advanced-react-cli](https://github.com/devisle/advanced-react-cli) - An npm package which aims to provide a better way to install packages for your react application through an intuitive CLI.
- [devisle/devisle](https://github.com/devisle/devisle) - Official Dev Isle website!

For all of my projects and contributions, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/endormi).
